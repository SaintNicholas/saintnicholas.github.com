title: About Me
---

My name is Nick Goote, and I am currently living in Hudsonville, MI.  I am a Software Project Engineer at [Gentex Corporation](www.gentex.com), but I hope to soon get back into software development.  To keep my programming knowledge and skills up to date, I take college classes and I do personal projects outside of work.

I put this site together as a place to collect the different projects that I am working on.  My [original server setup](/about/old_server_setup) was running on one of my personal computers, using Apache and DokuWiki.  My [new server setup](/about/new_server_setup) is running on GitHub Pages, being generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
