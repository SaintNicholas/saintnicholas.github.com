title: About Me
---

My name is Nick Goote, and I am currently living in Hudsonville, MI.  I am a Software Developer at [Gentex Corporation](www.gentex.com).  To keep my programming knowledge and skills up to date, I take college classes and I do personal projects outside of work.

I put this site together as a place to try out a personal website, and to go along with the projects that I work on, which are hosted on Github.  My new server setup is running on GitHub Pages, being generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
