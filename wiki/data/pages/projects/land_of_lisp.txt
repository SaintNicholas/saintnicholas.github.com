I have never done any LISP programming, and wanted to get some experience with it.  I decided to go through the book [[http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1294115766&sr=8-1|Land of Lisp]], doing different programming exercises as I went through it.  Land of Lisp doesn't have specific programming exercises, so I did slightly modified versions of the games that were presented in the book.

The github repository where my solutions can be found is located at: \\
