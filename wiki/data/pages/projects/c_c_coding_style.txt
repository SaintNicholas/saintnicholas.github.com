File Names \\
Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores (_) or dashes (-)

Type Names \\
Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores: MyExcitingClass, MyExcitingEnum.

Variable Names \\
Variable names are all lowercase, with underscores between words. Class member variables have trailing underscores. For instance: my_exciting_local_variable, my_exciting_member_variable_.

Constant Names \\
Use a k followed by mixed case: kDaysInAWeek.

Function Names \\
Regular functions have mixed case, accessors and mutators match the name of the variable: MyExcitingFunction(), MyExcitingMethod(), my_exciting_member_variable(), set_my_exciting_member_variable().

Enumerator Names \\
Enumerators should be named either like constants or like macros: either kEnumName or ENUM_NAME.

Macro Names \\
You're not really going to define a macro, are you? If you do, they're like this: MY_MACRO_THAT_SCARES_SMALL_CHILDREN.

Spaces vs Tabs \\
Use only spaces, and indent 2 spaces at a time.

Function Calls \\
One line if it's under the 80 character limit, else: \\
bool retval = DoSomething(argument1, \\
                          argument2, \\
                          argument3, \\
                          argument4); \\

Conditionals: \\
if (condition) {  // no spaces inside parentheses \\
  ...  // 2 space indent. \\
} else {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace. \\
  ... \\
} \\
