I have never done any LISP programming, and wanted to get some experience with it.  I decided to go through the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294115766&amp;sr=8-1" class="urlextern" title="http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294115766&amp;sr=8-1"  rel="nofollow">Land of Lisp</a>, doing different programming exercises as I went through it.  Land of Lisp doesn&#039;t have specific programming exercises, so I did slightly modified versions of the games that were presented in the book.
