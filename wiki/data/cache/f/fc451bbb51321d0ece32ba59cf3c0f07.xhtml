I have done C++ development starting at the undergraduate level, and continuing into work and grad school.  However, I haven&#039;t ever learned all of the C++ capabilities start to finish, which I feel would be beneficial.  To do this, I decided to go through the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Primer-Plus-5th-Stephen-Prata/dp/0672326973/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294115509&amp;sr=8-1" class="urlextern" title="http://www.amazon.com/Primer-Plus-5th-Stephen-Prata/dp/0672326973/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294115509&amp;sr=8-1"  rel="nofollow">C++ Primer Plus</a>, doing all of the programming exercises as I went through the book.
